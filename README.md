## Project Overview
Energy demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing energy distribution and avoiding wastage. In this project:
- Historical energy demand data is processed and analyzed.
- Advanced machine learning algorithms, including **XGBoost**, are applied for predictive modeling.
- Time series techniques are utilized to capture temporal patterns in energy consumption.

---

## Features and Methodology
- **Time Series Analysis**: Extracting seasonality, trend, and noise components from the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating features like lagged values, rolling means, and time-based attributes (hour, day, month, etc.).
- **Modeling with XGBoost**:
  - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
  - Handling missing values and outliers in the dataset.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
  - Cross-validation for robust evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` (Data manipulation and analysis)
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (Visualization)
  - `XGBoost` (Machine learning model)

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption). It contains historical energy consumption data, for specific regions in the United States with features such as:
- Timestamps
- Energy consumption (kWh)

The dataset covers various regions in the United States, this model  is trained and tested on Eastern Interconnection grid operating an electric transmission system serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. This is known as the PJM East Region.

**Preprocessing Steps**:
- Select a valid region in the United States to train or test the model 
- Determine features
